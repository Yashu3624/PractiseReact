everything in react we can create with html ,css, js 
then why react ?
-------- react  -- makes ur develeoper experience
                -- write less no of code
                --modif


best practise - make seperate files for seperate components


---folder structure-------

In react project we keep all the files ins src .


in components name the components as same it is.

In app.js first we need to import the components 
but before that export the components
1.export 
2.import


nEVER KEEP THE hard coded data in components like resList .

cdn url also a hard coded string so keep it in seperate files 

util folder == commonfolder

one way to export is export default component name       --- default export
2.named export - in single file export multiple things .

we can not write a default twice .
export default cdn_URL
export default logo_url  throws an error .


so write export infront of that variable . (multipled files to export in a file)
then the import will be 
  export const component 
  we can import named component as 
  =---------------- import {component} from path

Home work -can we use both of these export at once



       --- REACT HOOKS     -- ---

       ... BUTTON - FILTER  --TOP RATED RESTAURANT
       react is fast in dom manipulation .


state varible - powerful variable -- react hook - used state. 
hook - normal javascript function - prebuild - superpowers --


2 imp HOOKS 
1.useState() -- super powerful react variable in react
                     it maintains the state of the variable .
----------
       import {useState} from "react";

creation of local variable ;
const [listOfRestaurant] = useState();------{state variable}
let listOfRestaurant  {normal variable}

when we call this useState() it will give a state variable which is revieved through listOfRestaurant .

whenever a statevariable updates  react rerenders components

const [listOfRestaurant , setListOfRestaurnat] = useState(resList) ; --- RECONSILIATION starts when setListOfRestaurnat is called 

then react find out the div and update the UI

const [listOfRestaurant , setListOfRestaurnat] = useState(resList) ; array destructruing .
2.useEffect()


---------------
  {"                                RECONSILIATION ALGORITHM   -- react fiber    {react 16}       "                        }


              RES -container contains - 7 data cards and  it change to  3 cards using filter and ui will change along with it using hooks useState 

              virtual dom is actual representation of DOM 
              
              \\ actual dom  |   \\ virtual DOM
                                   react obj 
              <div>          |
              <div>
              <img>          | 

 

 Diff ALGORITHM - find outs the diff between 2 virtual doms .

               \\ old virtual dom         |   \\New virtual DOM
                                                 react obj 
                                          |
            
                                          | 

 actually update the dom - rerenders.
